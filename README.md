# 📱 iOS Internship – Swift & UIKit Projects

Welcome to the repository documenting my iOS development journey during the internship program (Dec 2024 – Jan 2025). This internship focused on gaining hands-on experience with Swift programming, UIKit, and building interactive iOS applications using Xcode.

## 🚀 Overview

During the course of the internship, I learned and practiced:

- Swift language fundamentals
- UIKit components and layout techniques
- Auto Layout & Stack Views
- Navigation & Segue
- Storyboards & Interface Builder
- Multi-screen app development using Navigation and Tab Bar Controllers
- File handling using `FileManager` and persistent storage via `UserDefaults`

The final assigned project was a **Calculator App with History**. Before that, I worked on multiple practice mini-projects to strengthen my understanding of concepts.

## 🧠 Internship Learning Highlights

- ✅ Swift Syntax, Variables, Constants, Data Types
- ✅ Control Flow (Loops, Conditionals)
- ✅ Functions and Closures
- ✅ OOP Concepts: Structs, Classes, Protocols
- ✅ UIKit: Buttons, Labels, TextFields, ImageViews
- ✅ UIViewController Lifecycle
- ✅ Storyboards, Segues, and Programmatic Navigation
- ✅ Auto Layout and Responsive Design
- ✅ Tab Bar and Navigation Controllers
- ✅ Optionals and Enums
- ✅ File Handling & Persistent Storage

## 🛠️ Practice Projects

These mini-projects were created as part of self-practice during the internship to implement and reinforce newly learned concepts:

- `AutoLayout` – Experiments with dynamic constraints
- `Calculator` – Basic calculator logic using Swift
- `CommonInputControls` – Working with text fields, buttons, switches, etc.
- `constraints_bet_sib` – Layout using constraints between sibling elements
- `DisplayData` – Showing structured data on screen
- `LabBasicControls` – UIKit control exploration
- `LabLogin` – Simple login screen with validation
- `Light` – Basic toggle switch UI app
- `ProgrammaticSegues` – Navigation using code
- `Rainbow` – UI color change logic
- `RainbowChallenge` – Challenge project for UI logic
- `RainbowTabs` – Tab bar controller implementation
- `traffic` – Traffic light simulation with button interaction

## 🎯 Final Assigned Project (Feb 2025)

**Project Title**: Calculator App with History  
**Objective**: To build an iOS app that performs basic arithmetic operations and maintains a history of all calculations performed.

### 🔧 Features:
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Store all calculations locally with history view
- Clear history functionality
- Simple and responsive UI design
- Multi-screen app using Navigation & Tab Bar Controllers
