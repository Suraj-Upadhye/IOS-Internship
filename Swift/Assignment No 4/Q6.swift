// ## App Exercise - Finding a Heart Rate  
// 6. Many APIs that give you information gathered by the hardware return optionals. For 
// example, an API for working with a heart rate monitor may give you `nil` if the heart 
// rate monitor is adjusted poorly and cannot properly read the user's heart rate. Declare a 
// variable `heartRate` of type `Int?` and set it to `nil`. Print the value. 

var heartRate: Int? = nil
print(heartRate)
