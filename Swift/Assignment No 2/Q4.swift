// 4. Now imagine you are making a social app for sharing your favorite books. Create a Book struct with four variable properties: title, author, pages, and price. The default values for both title and author should be an empty string. pages should default to 0, and price should default to 0.0. 

struct Book {
    var title = ""
    var author = ""
    var pages = 0
    var price = 0.0
}

// var book = Book()
// print("Book title: \(book.title), Book author: \(book.author), Book pages: \(book.pages), Book price: \(book.price)")
